Philips Hue + Leapmotion testbed

Requires:
* phue `https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue` - a Philips Hue library
* Leap Motion SDK - in particular, `Leap.py`, `LeapPython.so` and `libLeap.so`

Usage:
This is just a proof of concept. Edit the Hue Bridge IP and username, run leapd and run the script.
You should be able to turn the first Hue light on/off by swiping your hand sideways and change the brightness
by drawing circles with your finger.
